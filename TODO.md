## User abilities:
- User should have ability make simple notes (maybe in markdown format)
- User should can making touchable links between notes
This scheme produces graph and this graph should be visualized. Set of notes called a wiki (wiki is a temp name maybe)

### Wiki can be
  - private (it means that the wiki created by user is accessible only to him)
  - public (it means that the user-created wiki is accessible to everywhere)
  - maybe other custom read write rights...
